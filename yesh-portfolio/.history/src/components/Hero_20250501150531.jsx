          <p>
            Impact-Oriented and Agile Full Stack Software Engineer with 3+ years
            of experience specializing in Frontend Development, while actively
            investing in Cloud and AI advancements. I have built and scaled
            customer service platforms supporting 100,000+ global users across
            the USA, UK, Canada, and India.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical expertise includes ReactJS, NodeJS, AWS, Kubernetes,
            Docker, and .NET. I have successfully led multiple proof-of-concept
            initiatives, including architecting UI configurations for multiple
            countries through a zero-code-change config file system, and
            implementing AWS Lambda-based serverless architectures that reduced
            resource costs by 80% â€” recognized by Senior Vice Presidents, Senior
            Architects, and Project Managers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about delivering scalable, efficient solutions,
            pushing the boundaries of frontend excellence, and continuously
            exploring AI innovations to stay at the forefront of technology.
